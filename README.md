## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology.

## What is Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

## What is Continuous Deployment?

Continuous Deployment is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes are correct and if they meet quality criteria. It is the natural extension of Continuous Integration: an approach in which teams ensure that every change to the system is releasable.

## Virtualization

Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based, or virtual, representation of something, such as virtual applications, servers, storage, and networks. It is the single most effective way to reduce IT expenses while boosting efficiency and agility for all size businesses.

## Linux

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.

Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel in 1991. He developed the Linux kernel on MINIX using the GNU C Compiler. He was inspired by MINIX, a Unix-like operating system based on a microkernel architecture.
